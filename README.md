# Quadratic Funding Voting -  Donation Analysis


This project  analyzes the change and percentage change in the amount of money directed from the reward pool to Project1 as a result of a donation made during a Quadratic Funding vote.
##Â Data Set
The dataset includes the percentage of the donation to the total income and the increase in the amount for each donation amount made to Project1 during a Quadratic Funding vote. The following three pieces of information are given for each donation amount:

* donation: The amount of donation
* percentage: The percentage of the donation to the total income
* amount: The increase in the donation amount

Looking at the graph, we see that both the percentage and the amount increase as the donation amount increases.

The blue line represents the percentage of the donation to the total income, while the red line represents the increase in the amount. Both variables increase with the donation amount. However, we can observe that the amount (red line) increases faster than the percentage (blue line)."

## Projects in the Vote
The example projects in the vote and the amounts donated to each are as follows:

```
project1: [10, 5, 20]
project2: [5, 15]
project3: [10, 10, 10, 10]
```
In this scenario, the user donates to Project1 in amounts ranging from 1 to 100 dollars.
## Analysis

The data set shows that as the donation amount increases, the percentage and the amount also increase.

Donation vs Percentage and Amount

Looking at the graph, we can see that the blue line represents the percentage of the donation to the total income, and the red line represents the increase in the amount. Both variables increase with the donation amount. However, we can observe that the amount (red line) increases faster than the percentage (blue line).

This shows that during a Quadratic Funding vote, as the donation amount increases, more money is directed to Project1 from the reward pool. This means that larger donations have a greater impact than smaller ones.


## Conclusion
Quadratic Funding is an effective method to maximize the impact of donations. This analysis shows that as the donation amount increases, the amount of money directed from the reward pool to Project1 and the percentage of the donation to the total income increase. This shows that larger donations have a greater impact than smaller ones. However, this does not mean that a certain donation amount will always be the most efficient. Therefore, caution should be exercised when participating in a Quadratic Funding vote.
